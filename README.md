#      Realtime Sentiment Analysis on Twitter         #


This program searches a keyword in Twitter and returns current Tweets containing the keyword and the predicted sentiment (positive/negative).

It uitilizes NLTK to parse sentence structure and determines sentence polarity with NLTK's perceptron tagger trained on the NLTK Twitter Corpus and the Sentence Polarity Corpus: [http://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html](http://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html/).

If you'd like to retrain the perceptron on different data, use Train_Classifiers.py.

If you'd like to simply run the sentiment bot with the data I trained on run Twitter_API_connect.py
